-  **system building** for strict adherence to original requirements and specifications (in analysis and design);

Over 30 years in software projects development has given me marketing and sales management experience with exceptional cross cultural management skills (from USA to Canada to UK and Nigeria).

As a Diaspora and highly skilled professional (HSP) in corporate America, with more than 20 years experience in `software development`, I proved that the new globally accepted brain circulation phenomenon exploitation (brain gain) works in Nigeria, by developing and maintaining software for corporate USA customers from my office in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. I used dollar inflow to develop series of critical software packages deployed into the Nigerian economy.
